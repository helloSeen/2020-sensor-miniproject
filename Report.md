## Summary
This project focuses on the integration and analysis of internet-based sensors. It serves as an introduction to Python, web-based data transfer, and simple data analysis.  
To simulate the sensors, a server and its clients are locally-hosted. The server maintains the client connections and the clients output timestamped messages about the occupancy, temperature, and CO2 level of a room in a building.


## Task 0
The client outputs json-formatted messages like the following:  
`{"class1": {"time": "2020-09-09T16:24:40.498528", "temperature": [26.991743538688336], "occupancy": [19], "co2": [28.24985548185597]}}` 

The server issues the following greeting string to the client when intially connected:
`ECE Senior Capstone IoT simulator`
